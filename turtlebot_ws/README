***HOW TO RUN***
1-First change the urdf and yaml file paths in the gazebo_c.cpp and
gazebo_c_2.cpp
2-catkin_make
3-roslaunch gazebo_sim create.launch will run the code.
4-If your pc is slow create.launch may not work well. In that case,
run the following commands in terminals;
roscore
rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo
rosrun gazebo_sim gazebo_ros_node
rosrun target_finder target_finder_node_3
rosrun gazebo_sim gazebo_ros_node2
rosrun target_finder target_finder_node_2
rosrun navigation2 navigation_node2
rosrun navigation navigation_node

***Expected Result***
These commands will open the gazebo and spawn 2 robots and 1 red obstacle.
The robot with green back is leader and the other one is  follower. 
If the code run properly, robots will move to the goal and the follower
will follow the leader.
